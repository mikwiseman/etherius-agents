# Etherius Agent - NFT Intelligence Service

## üéØ Purpose

The Etherius Agent is an AI-powered NFT intelligence service that bridges natural language queries with real-time NFT marketplace data. Built on Fetch.ai's decentralized agent framework, it democratizes access to NFT market insights by allowing users to query complex NFT data using simple conversational language.

## üöÄ Core Functionalities

### 1. **Natural Language NFT Queries**
- Interprets user intent from conversational queries
- Automatically determines the appropriate OpenSea MCP tool to use
- Handles complex queries about collections, trends, and market data

### 2. **OpenSea MCP Integration**
- **Search Collections**: Find NFT collections by name or keyword
- **Get Collection Details**: Retrieve comprehensive stats including floor price, volume, holders
- **Trending Analysis**: Identify trending collections across different timeframes (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- **Top Collections**: Rank collections by various metrics (volume, sales, floor price)

### 3. **Intelligent Response Formatting**
- Parses raw OpenSea data into human-readable summaries
- Formats prices, volumes, and statistics clearly
- Provides relevant OpenSea links for further exploration
- Presents data in organized bullet points or tables

### 4. **REST API Service**
- Simple HTTP endpoint for integration: `POST /chat`
- Health check endpoint: `GET /health`
- JSON request/response format for easy integration

## üìã Usage Guidelines

### Query Examples
```
"Show me the top 5 NFT collections by trading volume"
"What's the floor price for Bored Apes?"
"Find trending collections on Ethereum in the last 24 hours"
"Search for gaming NFT collections"
"Get detailed stats for Pudgy Penguins"
```

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Include collection names, timeframes, or metrics when possible
2. **Use Natural Language**: No need for technical terms or exact syntax
3. **Iterate**: Follow up with more specific questions based on initial results
4. **Verify Data**: Cross-reference critical data points with OpenSea directly

### Integration Guidelines
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect OpenSea MCP rate limits (varies by tier)
- **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for transient failures
- **Caching**: Consider caching responses for frequently requested data
- **Security**: Never expose API keys in client-side code

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- Python 3.9+ runtime
- uAgents framework (v0.22.5)
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligence
- OpenSea MCP for marketplace data
- HTTPX for async HTTP operations

### Performance
- Average response time: 2-5 seconds
- Concurrent request handling via async architecture
- Automatic session management for MCP connections
- Intelligent request batching when possible

### Limitations
- Requires OpenSea MCP beta access token
- Limited to OpenSea marketplace data
- Response quality depends on GPT-4o availability
- Real-time data subject to OpenSea API latency
